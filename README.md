# Time Series Analysis in MATLAB and Python

This repository contains a comprehensive guide and implementation for analyzing time series data using MATLAB and Python. The focus is on understanding and applying various techniques essential for time series analysis, with detailed scripts and examples.

## **Main Features**

### 1. **Correlation Analysis**
   - **Pearson Correlation**: Measures the linear relationship between two variables.
   - **Running Correlation**: Calculates the correlation over a moving window to observe changes over time.
   - **Cross-Correlation**: Analyzes the lagged relationship between two time series.

### 2. **Smoothing Techniques**
   - **Trailing Average**: Smooths the time series using a cumulative average of prior values.
   - **Moving Average**: Applies a fixed-sized rolling window to reduce noise and highlight trends.

## **Dependencies**
- **MATLAB 2018 or later** (for MATLAB scripts).
- **Python 3.7 or later** with the following libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy` (for advanced statistical operations)
